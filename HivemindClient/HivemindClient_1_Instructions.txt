Hivemind Client Instructions - Client #1

Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to Hivemind Server

1. Ensure this laptop is connected to the SAME Wi-Fi or LAN network as the HivemindServer host.

2. Open the HivemindClient folder in Visual Studio Code or terminal.

3. Edit the HivemindClient.cs file:
   Locate the following line:
       const string serverIP = "127.0.0.1";
   Replace it with:
       const string serverIP = "192.168.1.42";

   (This is the LAN IP of the main laptop running HivemindServer)

4. Save the file.

5. Open a terminal in the HivemindClient folder and build the project:
       dotnet build

6. Run the client:
       dotnet run

7. Type messages and press Enter to send.
   Type '/exit' to disconnect.

If the connection fails:
- Double-check the server IP
- Ensure the server is running and listening on port 5000
- Make sure firewall settings on the server allow incoming TCP on port 5000

Happy messaging with the Hive!
